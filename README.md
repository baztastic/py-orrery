# py-orrery
An 3-dimensional model of the solar system (orrery) built in python.

Uses VPython for graphics and Skyfield for planetary ephemeris & positions.

This is inspired by The Expanse series of books as a way to visualise just how huge space is.

I plan to add other objects, such as stations, etc. and a model of how long flights would actually take with the fictional constant-burn Epstein drive.
